  content: I recently graduated from <a href="https://grenoble-em.com" target="_blank" class="links">GEM</a>, and spent an exchange semester at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" class="links">McGill University</a> ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. In my spare time, I take <a href="https://jeanguillet.photo" target="_blank" class='links'>photos</a>, do video editing, and code stuff in Python. I thought I'd put up this simple website to tell a little bit more about me.

  title: My experiences?
  content: I've been working as a <b>Trade Merchandiser</b> at <a href="https://www.ebay.fr/" target="_blank" class="links">eBay.fr</a>, from July 2020 to December 2021, in direct contact with sellers and brands, to implement the commercial calendar. <br /> Before that, I was a <b>Product intern</b> at <a href="https://www.mytraffic.io/" target="_blank" class="links">MyTraffic.io</a> where I took part in the development of a new location intelligence SaaS, and also helped releasing <a href="https://www.monlocalcommercial.fr/" target="_blank" class="links">MonLocalCommercial.fr</a>. In the meantime, I started using Python for scraping and scripting purposes, and got to play with <a href="https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/api" target="_blank" class="links">geocoding REST APIs</a>.<br /> I also worked as a <b>CRM and Merchandising intern</b> at <a href="https://www.manomano.fr/" target="_blank" class="links">ManoMano</a> from June to November 2018. There, I learnt to create targeted emailing campaigns, built HTML emails with <a href="https://dartagnan.io/fr" target="_blank" class="links">Dartagnan.io</a>, and monitoring dashboards with SQL and <a href="https://metabase.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Metabase</a>.<br /> Earlier on, I worked for 3 months as a motion design intern for <a href="https://www.targetfirst.com/" target="_blank" class="links">TargetFirst</a>, and a marketing intern at <a href="https://www.galbani.fr/" target="_blank" class="links">Galbani</a>.
aspirations:
  title: What do I like to work on?
  content: I enjoy working on web products with marketers, developers and designers, discussing UX/UI issues, automating stuff with APIs and scripts to work smarter, projects that enable me to learn new tools, and eventually code by myself.

aboutsite:
  title: How did I code this website?
  content: This static website is built using Python, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/" target="_blank" class="links">Flask</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Bootstrap</a>. It was made static thanks to <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/" target="_blank" class="links">Frozen-Flask</a>, and I make the deploys to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Netlify servers</a>. Coming from a commercial background, this project made it possible for me to play with several web technologies, and push my web development skills further.<br /> As a matter of facts, I believe that even non-tech profiles should have a good technical understanding of their environment. You feel the same? Great, <a href="mailto:jean.guillet1@gmail.com?subject=Hello Jean!" class="links">Let's talk about it</a>!</p>
endphrase: That's all folks ;)
